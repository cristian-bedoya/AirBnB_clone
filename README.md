Environment develpment used was:

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Python 3.4.3
- Interpreter’s Python
- Json File
- OOP programming


## Content

This project allow you create User, City and State and save with unique ID, Datetime, as well as update them.

## Data hierarchy:

(hbnb) all
["[User] (db83e8f2-e3f1-4710-8e29-48ce638e423a) {'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 9, 83951), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 9, 84173), 'id': 'db83e8f2-e3f1-4710-8e29-48ce638e423a'}", "[City] (54a4cff6-d271-412b-8236-ba534947e819) {'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 12, 639999), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 12, 640148), 'id': '54a4cff6-d271-412b-8236-ba534947e819'}", "[State] (e04290ed-5b95-49b2-8082-af4ddaafa23f) {'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 18, 29407), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 5, 15, 22, 18, 29606), 'id': 'e04290ed-5b95-49b2-8082-af4ddaafa23f'}"]
